You walk for what feels like hours, until you come to an inn along the path. Three individuals sit at a table just outside: a mage, a barkeep, and a knight. They are playing a game where they each take turns moving, while they have one masked observer. The masked observer speaks to you, \"I'll make you a deal. If you answer my question correctly, you'll be allowed to pass unharmed, and I'll even give you a hint to what lies ahead. But if you're wrong, you'll be stuck here playing this menial game for my enjoyment.\" He cackles.",

But every path has only one proper order.\" You know the summit is near when you come across a grove where an hermit resides. He comes out of his hut as you approach. With a crazed look in his eyes, he proclaims enigmatically, \"Get past me and nothing will stand between you and the summit! Except, perhaps, the Cylean.\" You don't know what that is, but that doesn't matter until you pass this next test. The hermit continues.",

There stands a being unlike any you've seen before; this must be the Cylean, and hovering in the air beside them is a large glowing cube. You approach and they say, \"I'm impressed! Few make it this far. But every challenge you've faced was nothing compared to this. This cube beside me holds within it several smaller cubes, each one cubic unit.\" It is at that moment you notice faint grid lines forming squares across the surface of the cube.",
